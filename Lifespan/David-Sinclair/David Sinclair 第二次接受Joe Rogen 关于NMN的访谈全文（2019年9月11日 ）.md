Intro

    David Sinclair (@davidasinclair) is a Professor in the Department of Genetics at Harvard Medical School
        He’s the author of the new book – Lifespan: Why We Age and Why We Don’t Have ToCheck out the Podcast Notes from David’s last appearance on The Joe Rogan Experience

Examining a Recent Aging Study

    A recent study showed that a combination of metformin, DHEA, and human growth hormone resulted in a decrease of ~2 years in terms of biological age
        BUT – the study only involved 9 people“Is aging truly reversible? That’s what this study suggests… One day we could be 80, but biologically be 30.”The above study also saw a reduction of a protein called C 38
        C 38 resides on immune cells and increases in quantity as we ageC 38 is the main enzyme in our body that degrades NAD+ – NAD+ is required for sirtuins to function (sirtuins are genes which protect all organisms from deterioration and disease)

The Horvath Clock | How Biological Age is Measured

    What is it?
        On letter C of DNA (remember – DNA consists of 4 letters: A, C, T, and G), there are chemical modifications that change in very linear and predictable ways
            Reading these chemical modifications allows one to determine biological age AND the age at which you’re likely to die“Now that we know how to measure aging, we think that the Horvath clock is part of the aging process. We’re learning how to reverse it too.”
        “I think, as we use this clock, we’re going to figure out a whole bunch of stuff that we can do to not just slow aging, but reverse it. And not just by 2.5 years. With some of the technology I talk about in my book, I think we could turn the clock back by a decade or more.”

The CORRECT Theory of Aging

    The old theory stated that we age because we lose DNA/it’s damagedDavid has a new proposal:
        We age because our DNA gets modified and our cells lose the ability to read it the way they used to

Antioxidants & Resveratrol

    “Antioxidants have been the biggest disappointment in the aging field… Antioxidants have, with very few exceptions, failed to extend the lifespan of any organism.”That being said, David still supplements with resveratrol
        Resveratrol is a mild antioxidant – “But the way it really works is it stimulates the body’s defenses against aging and disease”
            How? – It binds to sirtuins which, as mentioned, are sort of like the body’s defenders David mixes his resveratrol with yogurt every morning – he takes ~0.5 grams
            Why yogurt? – It’s important to take the resveratrol with fat to increases absorption
                In David’s studies (in both humans and mice), if resveratrol was not given with fat, absorption was 5-fold lessDavid makes the yogurt himself out of whole milk David has found that treating mice with resveratrol makes them resistant to the negative side effects associated with eating a high-fat/Western diet
        What dose? – A human equivalent of 250 mg/daySpecifically – their livers, arteries, and metabolic markers mimicked those of healthy, lean, and young mice

NMN

    NMN is a precursor to NAD+
        David takes 1 gram every morning mixed in with his yogurtIn mice, tt’s been found that NMN improves blood flow
        “They get the benefit of exercise without having to exercise”AND – the NMN was found to increase the amount of time these mice ran until exhaustion 

Metformin Decreases Physical Performance

    Although metformin may have an anti-aging effect, some studies show it decreases physical performance in athletes
        Because of this, David only takes metformin on days he doesn’t exerciseWhy does metformin decrease physical performance?
        David has a hypothesis – Metformin is interfering with our mitochondria and disrupts its energy production
            Because of this, later on, the body responds by making more mitochondria to make up for the energy loss (hence the benefit of metformin)

David’s Workout Routine

    David only spends ~3 hours a week in the gym (and he does it all in one day)
        “I’d work out more if I had time. I’m usually working until midnight.”He lifts weights for ~1 hour, stretches, and then does some hot/cold therapy (a sauna/cold tub)

Wild Animals & David’s Recent African Safari

    David recently vacationed in Africa for 16 days with his 3 kids (ages 16, 14, and 12) and father (who just turned 80) – he has some photos on his Instagram
        Where specifically? – Kenya, Tanzania, and Uganda
            “The Serengeti was absolutely incredible”“When you see a wildebeest get attacked and chewed on for 45 minutes by a crocodile, there’s nothing better than going back to the camp and having a beer to calm down”
            “One of the things you realize when your among these animals is it’s a huge privilege to be able to go for a walk without being eaten”‘“I recommend everyone go to Africa, not just to come back a better person and a better human being, but also to support them. They really need our help over there.”Joe saw a grizzly bear once while hunting
        “Black bears are unnerving, grizzly bears are terrifying”One day, while Joe was driving in Santa Barbara, he saw a mountain lion run across the road“F**k keeping monkeys in a cage. That drives me so crazy. I hate it. I took a pot edible once, a real strong one, and went to the zoo. It was so depressing staring at the chimps. I just sat across from them and watched. I thought, ‘Oh my God, these things are in hell. They’re in prison!'” – Joe

Isn’t aging natural?

    “People ask me about my work: ‘Isn’t what you’re doing unnatural?’ F**k natural. What about our world is natural anyway?”
        “I flew here at 30,000 feet drinking a cocktail while surfing the internet… not natural!”“Don’t give me the argument that aging is natural and therefore it’s acceptable”“What’s natural for primates is to change their environment”
        Using genetics to understand why we age and why we don’t have to is EXACTLY that

The Commonalities Among Centenarian

    The oldest human to ever live made it to 122 (this is actually debatable – some think the woman was subsumed by her daughter to avoid paying taxes)
        That being said, people have definitely lived to 117Centenarians often have a specific FOXO3 gene variant
        You can check to see if you have this variant with a 23andMe DNA Test“These long-lived people tend to live a long time no matter what they do” 

What problems might result if humans start living longer?

    One of the things people worry about if we all live longer is that we’ll run out of food and space
        “If you look at human history… that’s not going to happen”“I’m of the strong belief we can engineer our way out of just about any problem”What about climate change? Won’t it wipe us out?
        “I don’t think we can stop climate change at this point. It’s definitely happening; you can see it all around. But will it wipe us out? No. Will it cost us trillions of dollars? Yeah.”
            “It won’t be the end of us, but it’s going to be a challenge to continue to survive and proliferate as a species in the face of all those costs”“That’s one of the reasons I’m excited about extending people’s healthspans and lifespans, it’ll save tens of trillions in the globe each year. That’s money that can be put to combating global warming.”What about work? If people are living to 150-200, what will they do?
        They’ll continue working 

David’s 80-year-old Father’s Supplement Protocol

    Just like David, he takes NMN, metformin, a statin, and resveratrolHe also does a fair amount of aerobic exercise (rowing and stair climbing)
        David said he recently climbed 40 flights of stairs in just 15 minutes“He’s looking forward to another 10 years of vigorous life… When you’re healthy, you’re happy.”He recently picked up a new job as a committee member that evaluates clinical trials for ethics

50 is the New 30

    The older we get, the wiser we become
        “It’s going to be such a great world when people with 80 years of experience can continue to run companies, be teachers, and educate the young people”“I’m so much wiser at 52 than I was at 42. I just am. I make fewer mistakes and I’m more aware across the board. I was wiser at 42 than I was at 32. At 22, I was basically a chimp. As time goes on, you understand how you’re interfacing with the world. You communicate with people better. You know how to get by. You know what you have to do and what the consequences are of not doing what you have to do.” – JoeDavid adds:
        “When I was in my 20s, I thought I knew everything. I looked at myself as a 50-year-old and thought, “Wow, what an old fart.’ It’s not like that at all… 50-year-olds today are just like 30-year-olds twenty years ago.”“A 50-year-old isn’t old anymore. A 50-year-old is just getting going.”“In the future, 90 will feel like 50”“They’ll come a time when you can’t tell how old someone is”

Cholesterol

    David first discovered he had high cholesterol levels when he was 29
        He’s been on a super high-dose (~80 mg) statin ever since (a normal dose is ~10 mg)
            Why such a high dose? – He has REALLY bad genetics when it comes to cholesterol

Try to Be Hungry at Lease Once a Day

    David intermittent fasts as much as he can (he skips breakfast and has a late lunch)“For anyone that wants to know what the best periodic protocol is…there isn’t one. We don’t know yet.”As best as you can, try to be hungry at least once a day
        Sirtuins are activated when you’re hungry due to a rise in NAD+ levels (remember – NMN is also thought to raise NAD levels)

Intravenous NAD+

    David says he’s tried intramuscular NAD+ (it was an injection)
        “I had tingles in my legs. I felt a little different for maybe 10 minutes and then it went away.”Many people swear by intravenous NAD+, but as Peter Attia explained in these Podcast Notes, there’s just no evidence that the NAD+ is getting into the cells
        “The fact is, we don’t know if it works yet”

Xenohormesis

    What is it?
        Certain molecules (stress-response chemicals) are produced within plants to make them healthier in response to stress
            As a side effect, the plants turn more colorful “I believe we’ve evolved to sense those chemicals in our food supply”
        Our bodies benefit from these stress-response chemicals – they enter our bloodstream and turn on a variety of defense mechanisms against diseaseRed wine is filled with tons of healthy xenohormetic molecules – Resveratrol, quercetin, and polyphenols to name a few

Sleep

    David gets between 6-7 hours a nightHe wears an Oura Ring to track his sleep
        Purchase a ring using the above link for a $40 discountCheck out the Podcast Notes from Dr. Matthew Walker’s appearance on Joe’s podcast. A few things they discussed:
        There’s a direct correlation between a lack of sleep and Alzheimer’s diseaseAvoid Ambien
            David will occasionally take a very small dose (~1 mg) if he’s struggling with jet lag. He’ll sometimes take a small dose of melatonin as well.Wearing blue light blocking glasses a few hours before bed has greatly improved David’s sleep quality

Let’s Sum Up | How to Increase Your Healthspan

    ExerciseBe hungry at least once a dayUse cold/hot therapy (using the sauna in combination with a cold shower)Supplement with NMN and resveratrolAnother tip – wear sunscreen
        Why? – Over time, the sun causes DNA damage (it “breaks ” chromosomes) which accelerates aging (x-rays and airport scanners also do this)
            Going through an airport scanner gives you the same radiation dose you’d get on a 5-hour flightDavid has shown, in mice, that NMN protects against the effects of radiation
                For this reason, it might be a good idea to supplement with NMN before/after a flight or getting an x-ray

Nicotinamide Riboside (NR)

    NR is another NAD+ precursor (it’s thought to also boost NAD+ levels) – reputable brands include:
        Elysium Basis (Use the code “Podcast45” for $45 off a semi-annual or annual subscription)True Niagen Chromadex

CRISPR

    “I’m a big believer in CRISPR in the sense that it’ll revolutionize medicine”What is it?
        It’s an acronym for a bacterial system used to kill/destroy the DNA of invading organisms (like viruses)We can now use that system to cut and change specific parts of our own genomes
            It can also be used to insert new genes into the genome after cutting out unfavorable onesFrom David’s last appearance on Joe’s podcast:
        Recently, a Chinese researcher engineered twin baby girls with CRISPR to be resistant to HIV/AIDS – see more here
            The chance of getting HIV in China is 1/1000In theory, he could have made them resistant to anything (like cancer or heart disease) – HIV was only the first test

Digging Deeper Into Genetics | Genetic Reprogramming

    David and his team have, using a set of genes known as reprogramming factors (AKA Yamanaka factors), have been able to repair eyesight in mice
        How? – They put a set of the reprogramming genes into a benign virus and inject it straight into the mouse’s eyeball (the virus is just a way to get the genes into the cells)
            The genes are then turned on with an antibiotic David started a company centered around making this possible in humans
                The process will first be used to treat glaucoma and, if proven safe, eventually repair eyesight loss associated with old age“It’s only been a year since we’ve known about this. Imagine what we’ll be able to do in 50 or even 10. It’s going to be a remarkable future.”David next plans to attempt repairing spinal injuries in mice using this same method

Senolytics

    This is another field David is very excited aboutWhat are senolytics? – Drugs (a pill or injection) that kill off senescent cellsSenescent cells = zombie cells (AKA shut down cells)
        It’s been shown in animal studies that they cause agingOne study found that by genetically deleting the senescent cells which had accumulated in old mice, their aging was delayedSenescent cells raise a variety of inflammatory markersSenolytic therapies are close to becoming popularized
        David is working with Senolytic Therapeutics in Europe to make this possible

Wrapping Up

    TONS of aging research is on the horizon – it’s an exciting time to be in the field“We have things we can do in our daily lives, in both lifestyle and molecules you can take, that give us a VERY good chance of living beyond what’s naturally possible”
